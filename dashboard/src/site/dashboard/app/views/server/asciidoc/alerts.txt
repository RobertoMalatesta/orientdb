Alerts
------

You can configure alerts based on certain events that may occur over time (server down, metrics that exceed critical values).

Particularly when a metric or a log meets a certain condition can trigger the sending of an email, the execution
of an HTTP request or the execution of a function


[BOLD]*When:*

- Log
- Metric

[BOLD]*Do:*

- Send Mail
- Execute HTTP
- Execute Function

Let's take an example to better understand how events work:

If I would like to receive an email when an error happens on my server I can:

- click on "new event button";
- select "Log" on column "when";
- click "configure" button (on column "when") and  enter the necessary data as shown in figure "Log alert";

.Log alert

- now select "Mail" on "Do" column and click "configure" and  enter the necessary data as shown in figure  "Mail alert";

.Mail alert

- click on save button


TIP: There are some keywords that you can use for a better notification. Workbench will replace it with the right data.

NOTE: from address, to address, subject and body are mandatory in mail alert.

NOTE: for smtp configure please see Setting chapter.
